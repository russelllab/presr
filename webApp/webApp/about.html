  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    Here, we investigated MUNC18-1 variant pathogenicity in two ways:
    <p>
    <strong>First</strong>, we developed <strong>PRESR</strong> (<strong>PRE</strong>dictor of <strong>S</strong>TXBP1 <strong>R</strong>elated disorder),
    a machine learning-based predictor of missense variant pathogenicity using a diverse set of
    sequence- and 3D structure-derived features.
    On an independent test set of MUNC18-1 missense variants, PRESR performed better
    than previously existing predictors.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Second</strong>, the same test set of mutant proteins
    was examined by multiple biochemical and cell biological experiments in
    living neurons to determine the disease-causing denominators.
    </p>
    <p>
    We show that protein instability, decreased expression levels and
    impaired functionality underlie MUNC18-1 variant pathogenicity,
    which can be predicted with a high accuracy by PRESR.
    To enable the user to interrogate individual variants on a 3D structure and
    interpret the participation of features involved,
    we developed this webserver.
    The PRESR framework, tested and validated here for the STXBP1 syndrome,
    can be extended to other monogenic disorders to aid in uncovering disease mechanisms,
    improving diagnostic workflows, and making informed therapeutic decisions.
